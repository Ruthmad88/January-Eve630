1. Variable is something that stores values, i.e, like a memory.
2. Data type is a data that indicates th information to the system.
3. Function is something that performs some specific tasks.
4. An inbuilt fucntion is somthing that is already there in the programme.
5. 
6. Data structure is a variety or a format for organizing and storing data.
7. Modules are simply files with the “. py” extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program.
8. Variables with values that cannot be changed are just contants.
9. An identifier idetifies a function or a variable in a programme.
10. To carry out mathematical fucntions or logical computations, operators are used as symbols.


JAN 24TH Task:

1. mark1 = int(input("enter mark 1"))
mark2 = int(input("enter mark 2"))
mark3 = int(input("enter mark 3"))

if mark1>=33 and mark2>=33 and markfd 3>=33:
    print("you win")

else:
    print("you fail")

2. a = int(input("number of classes held"))
b = int(input("number of classes attended"))
medical = input("enter medical details")
c = b/a*100
if c>=75 or medical=="yes":
    print("allowed to enter exam room")
else:
    print("not allowed to enter exam room")

3. marks=int(input("enter marks"))
if marks>=35:
    print("pass")

else:
    print("fail")

To simplify the differnce the interpreter translkates just one statement of a program, while a compiler translates the entire program.

1. #int data type is nothing but integers, i.e, positive or negative whole numbers, zero. Intergers can be binary or even hexadecial values.

2. #float data type is nothing but intergers with a decimal number, for example, 99.5, 20.8, etc.
3. #boolean data type represents "True" or "False" values.

Jan 25th Task:

1. Comparison Operator: that compares two values and returns to the the boolean result, i.e, true or false. For example, >,<,==,etc.
2. Assignment Operator: is nothing but assigning a simple values to variables, like mark1 = 25,etc.
3. Logical Operator: they are simply based n boolean values, like AND, OR and NOT.
